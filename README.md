# Geometry Shapes Program using Java Programming Language
This is the project of the Object-Oriented and Visual Programming course. This project aims to do a geometry shapes calculation (the area, perimeter, and volume) with an object-oriented programming concept (abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism) using the Java programming language. 

The program accepts the choices of shapes to calculate and the shape's attributes (such as side, height, or length, etc.) that are input by the user then, it will process the shape's area, perimeter, and volume from the user input and the result will show the shape's area, perimeter, and volume. To run the program, you may run the main program it is IT001202000101.java.
